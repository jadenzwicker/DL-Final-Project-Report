%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have set unprecedented benchmarks in sentiment analysis, but their exceptional performance often comes at the cost of significant computational resources. This project investigates the viability of a lightweight, fine-tuned deep learning model capable of running on modest hardware, as a cost-effective alternative to models like BERT and GPT. Using IMDb’s movie review dataset \cite{IMDB-dataset}, we evaluate the performance of a 135M-parameter small LLM, “SmolLM,” leveraging few-shot learning and fine-tuning to improve its sentiment analysis capabilities.

The project benchmarks SmolLM against state-of-the-art LLMs, non-transformer deep learning networks such as CNNs and LSTMs, and traditional machine learning approaches like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forests. Performance metrics are derived from internal experimentation as well as from existing literature on this well-studied dataset.

Our goal is to demonstrate how fine-tuned small models can offer a competitive alternative to traditional methods and larger LLMs for relatively simple NLP tasks. In addition, we explore the diminishing returns of computationally intensive models, highlighting the potential to reduce deployment and operational costs without sacrificing performance. The outcomes of this work aim to guide practitioners in balancing accuracy with resource efficiency in sentiment analysis tasks.

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction/Background/Motivation}
This project aims to compare the performance and computational costs of small and large language models for sentiment analysis on the IMDb movie reviews dataset \cite{IMDB-dataset}. The objective is to demonstrate that simpler models, when properly tuned, can deliver competitive performance without the need for expensive computational resources. This project will also explore how the small and large language models compare to traditional machine learning models like naive bayes, logistic regression, and random forest learners. By showcasing the effectiveness of lightweight models, we seek to address the widespread over-reliance on large, resource-intensive models and provide a sufficient and cost effective alternative.

\textcolor{red}{(5 points) Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?} 





\subsection{Dataset}
The dataset chosen to test the various models sentiment analysis capabilities was the IMDb's movie Review dataset \cite{IMDB-dataset}. This dataset contains strings of movie reviews, which was pulled from IMDb's website in 2011 making it a sample of the total amount of reviews they store. Each movie review sample is accompanied by the dataset's binary sentiment classification of Positive or Negative. The dataset contains 50000 total samples with 25000 being for training and 25000 for testing with an approximately 50/50 split between Positive and Negative classifications. These specifics of the dataset make it very balanced leading to it being well tested in literature and the perfect benchmark for basic sentiment analysis. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Approach}

\textbf{Mention the models were run on A100 with 40gb for consistency among tests}
\textbf{HUGE NOTE, the order of pos vs neg in the asking of sentiment matters alot, first one listed tends to be the default models answer. 
Models tend to say true more because they see it first in the prompt, but to counter this they do default to negative.}

\section{Experiments and Results}

% To calculate the values of accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, and F-score, you need the confusion matrix or the key components: True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN). Here's how each metric is calculated:

% 1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances (both positive and negative) out of all instances.
%    \[
%    \text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
%    \]

% 2. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The proportion of actual positives correctly identified.
%    \[
%    \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
%    \]

% 3. **Specificity**: The proportion of actual negatives correctly identified.
%    \[
%    \text{Specificity} = \frac{TN}{TN + FP}
%    \]

% 4. **Precision**: The proportion of predicted positives that are actually positive.
%    \[
%    \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
%    \]

% 5. **F-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two.
%    \[
%    \text{F-Score} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
%    \]

(10 points) How did you measure success? What experiments were used? What were the results, both quantitative and qualitative? Did you succeed? Did you fail? Why? Justify your reasons with arguments supported by evidence and data.

\textbf{Important: This section should be rigorous and thorough. Present detailed information about decision you made, why you made them, and any evidence/experimentation to back them up. This is especially true if you leveraged existing architectures, pre-trained models, and code (i.e. do not just show results of fine-tuning a pre-trained model without any analysis, claims/evidence, and conclusions, as that tends to not make a strong project). }

% \section{Miscellaneous Information}

% The rest of the information in this format template has been adapted from CVPR 2020 and provides guidelines on the lower-level specifications regarding the paper's format.

% \subsection{Language}

% All manuscripts must be in English.


% \subsection{Paper length}
% Papers, excluding the references section,
% must be no longer than six pages in length. The references section
% will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the
% length of the references section. For example, a paper of six pages
% with two pages of references would have a total length of 8 pages.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{The ruler}
% The \LaTeX\ style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the
% version submitted for review.  The ruler is provided in order that
% reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without
% circumlocution.  If you are preparing a document using a non-\LaTeX\
% document preparation system, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to
% appear on the final output pages.  The presence or absence of the ruler
% should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.  The
% camera ready copy should not contain a ruler. (\LaTeX\ users may uncomment
% the \verb'\cvprfinalcopy' command in the document preamble.)  Reviewers:
% note that the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper
% --- this turns out to be very difficult to do well when the paper contains
% many figures and equations, and, when done, looks ugly.  Just use fractional
% references (e.g.\ this line is $095.5$), although in most cases one would
% expect that the approximate location will be adequate.

% \subsection{Mathematics}

% Please number all of your sections and displayed equations.  It is
% important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation.  Just
% because you didn't refer to it in the text doesn't mean some future reader
% might not need to refer to it.  It is cumbersome to have to use
% circumlocutions like ``the equation second from the top of page 3 column
% 1''.  (Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not
% an alternative to equation numbers).  All authors will benefit from reading
% Mermin's description of how to write mathematics:
% \url{http://www.pamitc.org/documents/mermin.pdf}.

% Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be
% found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report.  For conference
% submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the
% reviewer to go to a techreport for further details.  Thus, you may say in
% the body of the paper ``further details may be found
% in~\cite{Authors14b}''.  Then submit the techreport as additional material.
% Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material.

% Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool which
% is widely known to be restricted to a single institution.  For example,
% let's say it's 1969, you have solved a key problem on the Apollo lander,
% and you believe that the CVPR70 audience would like to hear about your
% solution.  The work is a development of your celebrated 1968 paper entitled
% ``Zero-g frobnication: How being the only people in the world with access to
% the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal.

% You can handle this paper like any other.  Don't write ``We show how to
% improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968].  This time we tested the
% algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''.
% That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors. Instead
% write the following:
% \begin{quotation}
% \noindent
%    We describe a system for zero-g frobnication.  This
%    system is new because it handles the following cases:
%    A, B.  Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] didn't
%    handle case B properly.  Ours handles it by including
%    a foo term in the bar integral.

%    ...

%    The proposed system was integrated with the Apollo
%    lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon, don't
%    you know.  It displayed the following behaviours
%    which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...
% \end{quotation}
% As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention,
% reads better than the first version, and does not explicitly name you as
% the authors.  A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was
% written by Zeus \etal, but cannot make any decision based on that guess.
% He or she would have to be sure that no other authors could have been
% contracted to solve problem B.
% \medskip

% \noindent
% FAQ\medskip\\
% {\bf Q:} Are acknowledgements OK?\\
% {\bf A:} No.  Leave them for the final copy.\medskip\\
% {\bf Q:} How do I cite my results reported in open challenges?
% {\bf A:} To conform with the double blind review policy, you can report results of other challenge participants together with your results in your paper. For your results, however, you should not identify yourself and should not mention your participation in the challenge. Instead present your results referring to the method proposed in your paper and draw conclusions based on the experimental comparison to other results.\medskip\\

% \subsection{Miscellaneous}

% \noindent
% Compare the following:\\
% \begin{tabular}{ll}
%  \verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
%  \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
% \end{tabular}\\
% See The \TeX book, p165.

% The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a
% sentence-ending space. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.  The provided
% \verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

% When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'',
% shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.)
% However, use it only when there are three or more authors.  Thus, the
% following is correct: ``
%    Frobnication has been trendy lately.
%    It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
%    Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

% This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...''
% because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.  If you use the
% \verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods
% when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.

% For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not
% chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors14} to
% \cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors14}.

% %------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Formatting your paper}

% All text must be in a two-column format. The total allowable width of the
% text area is $6\frac78$ inches (17.5 cm) wide by $8\frac78$ inches (22.54
% cm) high. Columns are to be $3\frac14$ inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a
% $\frac{5}{16}$ inch (0.8 cm) space between them. The main title (on the
% first page) should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the
% page. The second and following pages should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from
% the top edge. On all pages, the bottom margin should be 1-1/8 inches (2.86
% cm) from the bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper; for A4
% paper, approximately 1-5/8 inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the
% page.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Margins and page numbering}

% All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
% within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm)
% high.



% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Type-style and fonts}

% Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If neither is
% available on your word processor, please use the font closest in
% appearance to Times to which you have access.

% MAIN TITLE. Center the title 1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of
% the first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
% Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and
% adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or
% prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two blank
% lines after the title.

% AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title
% and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type. This information is to
% be followed by two blank lines.

% The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format.

% MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do NOT use
% double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6
% inch or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that is,
% flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank
% lines between paragraphs.

% Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in
% Figures~\ref{fig:onecol} and~\ref{fig:short}.  Short captions should be centred.

% \noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
% Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-,
% second-, and third-order headings.

% FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction})
% should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
% with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

% SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, { \bf 1.1. Database elements})
% should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
% with one blank line before, and one after. If you require a third-order
% heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially
% capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period
% and your text on the same line.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Footnotes}

% Please use footnotes\footnote {This is what a footnote looks like.  It
% often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly.
% Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral
% observations in
% the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).  If you
% wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on
% which it is referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{References}

% List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times,
% single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text,
% enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
% example~\cite{Authors14}.  Where appropriate, include the name(s) of
% editors of referenced books.

% Yours & Frobbly \\
% Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
% \hline
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% \caption{Results.   Ours is better.}
% \end{table}

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

% All graphics should be centered.  Please ensure that any point you wish to
% make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.  Resize fonts in figures
% to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths which render
% effectively in print.  Many readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic
% copy, will choose to print your paper in order to read it.  You cannot
% insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can
% zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

% When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
% \verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
% the line width as in the example below
% {\small\begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
%    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
%                    {myfile.eps}
% \end{verbatim}
% }
